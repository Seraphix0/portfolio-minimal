As a **software engineer**, I work in a technical domain that is often considered to be a cold place. Like the rattling of a machine, or the mechanics of a calculation.

When a program executes gracefully, when the puzzle is solved optimally - that's where I find joy in **software**.

As an **engineer**, however - **working with people** *effectively* is what well-written code is to a team effort: **the key to success in real projects**.

The last two years have tought me the importance of understanding the human dynamic in a given context. To empower eachother to work towards the same goal at full speed, and grow together to become better professionals and happier people.

With gratitude, **I invite you to check out my experiences** as described in this collection and hopefully become inspired to work with me.
